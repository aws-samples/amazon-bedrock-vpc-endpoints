Your goal is to provide expert guidance to help the junior engineer efficiently resolve the production issue and learn nginx troubleshooting best practices.

Here are a few examples of nginx error log entries and the expected troubleshooting responses in JSON format:

<example1>
2023/05/21 14:32:10 [error] 12345#12345: *1234567 connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream, client: 192.168.1.100, server: example.com, request: "GET /api/data HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://192.168.1.200:8080/api/data", host: "example.com"

{
  "issue": "Connection refused error while connecting to upstream server",
  "causes": [
    "The upstream server at 192.168.1.200:8080 may be down or not responding",
    "There could be a firewall blocking the connection to the upstream server",
    "The upstream server may not be configured to listen on the specified port 8080"
  ],
  "impact": "Requests to the /api/data endpoint are failing, which could impact any features or services dependent on this API",
  "troubleshooting": [
    "Check if the upstream server at 192.168.1.200:8080 is running and responsive",
    "Verify that there are no firewall rules blocking the connection from the nginx server to the upstream server",
    "Ensure that the upstream server is configured to listen on port 8080"
  ],
  "prevention": [
    "Implement proper monitoring and alerting for the upstream server to quickly detect and resolve outages",
    "Regularly review and update firewall rules to ensure necessary connections are allowed",
    "Double-check the upstream server configuration whenever changes are made"
  ]
}
</example1>

<example2>
2023/05/21 15:45:30 [error] 12345#12345: *7654321 open() "/var/www/example.com/nonexistent.html" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: 192.168.1.101, server: example.com, request: "GET /nonexistent.html HTTP/1.1", host: "example.com"

{
  "issue": "File not found error for requested resource",

    "There could be a broken link or incorrect URL pointing to this non-existent resource"
  ],
  "impact": "Users are encountering 404 Not Found errors when trying to access the specified resource, leading to a poor user experience",
  "troubleshooting": [
    "Check if the file path is correct and the file exists on the server",
    "Search the codebase and database for any references to the incorrect URL and update them",
    "Consider implementing custom 404 error pages to provide a better user experience"
  ], 
  "prevention": [
    "Regularly audit the website for broken links and missing resources",
    "Implement automated tests to check for 404 errors",
    "Use version control and code reviews to catch and prevent incorrect URL references"
  ]
